# ROBOPICO-with-FAVORIOT
This project leverages the Robo Pico board, integrated with the Raspberry Pi Pico WH, to showcase IoT data communication with the FAVORIOT platform. The project demonstrates real-time data transmission and device control using the MQTT protocol via CircuitPython.

**Sensors Used**:
  * Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04): Detects obstacles and measures distance.
  * Line Maker Sensor: Enables line-following functionality for robotic applications.
  * LDR Sensor: Measures ambient light intensity.
  * DHT11 Sensor: Monitors temperature and humidity levels.
  * Air Quality Sensor: Detects gas and air pollutants.

**Actuators Used**:
  * 2 Motors: Controls robotic movement and navigation.
  * 2 RGB LEDs: Provides multicolor visual feedback for system status or alerts.
  * Buzzer: Emits sound alerts and notifications.

**Project Highlights**:
  * Sensor data is transmitted to the FAVORIOT platform using the MQTT protocol, showcasing its effectiveness in IoT applications.
  * Commands received from FAVORIOT enable remote control of the actuators, including motors, LEDs, and the buzzer.
  * The project emphasizes the seamless integration of the Robo Pico board with FAVORIOT for IoT functionality.

By focusing on MQTT as the sole communication protocol, this project highlights how real-time data exchange and device control can be achieved efficiently using the Robo Pico board and FAVORIOT platform.
